USING THESE TEMPLATES
---

# Setup:

  The current instantiation of these templates are optimized only for the iPad.

  Here's one suggested workflow for rapidly modifying, testing and iterating
  on the templates to suit your needs on OS X:

  - Grab the templates from Github (done!)
  - Make sure the git repo is in your ~/Sites directory -> ~/Sites/bibliotype
  - Turn on web sharing under System Preferences > Sharing
  - Connect to your <computername>.local server and the 
    bibliotype subdirectory on your iPad
  - Tap the "Add to Home Screen" button â€” add to your home screen

  Edit the ~/Sites/bibliotype git repo in your favorite text editor and any
  changes you make will manifest in the edition on your iPad. Reload the 
  page to see changes (tap the home button and then click the Bibliotype icon
  or swipe right to reload). 



  Double tap to show menu with adjustments for:
  - Size
  - Justification
  - Font Family
  - Contrast
  - Grid Toggle
  - Hyphenation Toggle
